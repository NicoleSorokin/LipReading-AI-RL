# LipReading-AI-RL

This project focuses on building an AI system capable of lip-reading to detect potential malicious or threatening behavior when audio is unavailable or corrupted based on lip movements and key words. The system uses supervised learning for lip reading (mapping speech-to-text) and reinforcement learning (RL) to detect behaviors based on decoded speech.
